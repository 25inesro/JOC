	<h2>Favorite Projects</h2>
<h4>I chose to put in a project from the first semester and one from the second semester to see how different it is. In the first semester I focused on CodeHS and coding things based on users input. During the second semester I worked more on Photoshop and how to create collages, images, and GIFS. Both of these projects were challenging at the time, but rewarding!</h4>
