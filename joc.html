	<h2>Tech Innovation: Clearbot</h2>

<h4>I researched a recent tech innovation that interested me. I chose to research innovations that would help the trash in ocean. I read a lot about Clearbot and I thought it was interesting because it uses AI. It was hard to find information on the harmful effects it has because it really isn't doing anything harmful to ocean. I learned a lot about Clearbot and how it's helping the ocean's garbage.</h4>
